EARTHWORM â€“ A friend of farmer:

	Earthworm is an Artificial Intelligent that built using Inception v3 neural network model.
	It can diagnose multiple diseases of a plant by analysing the leaves of that plant. 
	For now, we have trained our model with 17 diseases of 3 different plants. 
	In future, we will increase the number of plants. Our trained model can detect the following diseases:
* Corn Common Rust (Puccinia sorghi)
* Corn Gray Leaf Spot (Cercospora zeae-maydis)
* Corn Healthy
* Corn Northern Leaf Blight (Exserohilum turcicum)
* Potato Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
* Potato Healthy
* Potato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)
* Tomato Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria)
* Tomato Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
* Tomato healthy
* Tomato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)
* Tomato Leaf Mold (Passalora fulva)
* Tomato Mosaic Virus
* Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria lycopersici)
* Tomato Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola)
* Tomato Two Spotted Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae)
* Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus

INSTRUCTIONS:
	
	Our trained model can be access by the following ways. We can give input either as a still image location or we can use our camera to capture the leaves of the plant. For giving input as a still image we can use Disease_Analyzer.py and we can give input in the in the file_name variable in that python file. There is also another way is available. We can use our camera to detect the diseases of the plant.
