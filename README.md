EARTHWORM – A friend of farmer:

	Earthworm is an Artificial Intelligent that built using Inception v3 neural network model. It can diagnose multiple diseases of a plant by analysing the leaves of that plant. For now, we have trained our model with 17 diseases of 3 different plants. In future, we will increase the number of plants. Our trained model can detect the following diseases:
* Corn Common Rust (Puccinia sorghi)
* Corn Gray Leaf Spot (Cercospora zeae-maydis)
* Corn Healthy
* Corn Northern Leaf Blight (Exserohilum turcicum)
* Potato Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
* Potato Healthy
* Potato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)
* Tomato Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria)
* Tomato Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
* Tomato healthy
* Tomato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)
* Tomato Leaf Mold (Passalora fulva)
* Tomato Mosaic Virus
* Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria lycopersici)
* Tomato Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola)
* Tomato Two Spotted Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae)
* Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus

INSTRUCTIONS:
	This trained model can be accessed by the Disease_Analyzer.py python file. Open the command prompt or anaconda prompt from the current repository. Then type the following python command in the command prompt:

“ python Disease_Analyzer.py --image test_img/corn_healthy.jpg “
